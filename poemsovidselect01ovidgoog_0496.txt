leon, Hamilcar, Hannibal, and Cato, with font-notes for
more rapid reading or for sight-reading. The vocabu-
lary covers both divisions oi the text. There are Exer-
cises in Writing Latin based on the text, and simple
word-groups for the study ol word-formation. Refer-
ences are given to the grammars of 'Allen and Green-
ough‚ Bennett, Gildersleeve and Lodge, Harkness, Lane
and Morgan.

lt has become customary in this country to substitute
other reading material for a portion of Caesar's Gallic
War, and for this purpose Nepos is particularly well
suited by the interest ol his subject-matter, the small-
ness of his vocabulary, and the clearness aud 'regularity
of his style. As a matter of fact, this author 'can easily
be read immediately after the completion of the elemen-
tary Latin lessons and in Mr. Barss’s edition the needs
oi the pupil who is just learning to read Latin are con·
stantly considered. His edition contains all of the
Lives that any teacher will care t0 have a class read.
The Sheffield Scientihc School accepts the first twelye
Lives as a substitute for two books oi Caesar, and
the Regents oi the State of New York allow the sub-
stitution of twenty Lives lor the entire requirement
of Caesar.
