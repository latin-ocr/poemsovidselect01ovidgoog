MACMILLAN'S LA ΤΙΝ SERIES

THE PLAN OF THE SERIES

HE different volumes' ol this Series¹ have been
prepared by practical teachers who have had
actual experience in teaching Latin in second-
ary schoolss Most of the text-books in Latin

now in use were made by instructors in colleges and
universitieS, and itis but natural that those who are
out of touch with secoudary education should-not in-
frequently fail to produce good schoolbooks. The
books of “Maemillan's Latin Series'' are intended
primarily lor school use, and have the pupil rather
than the teaeher in view. They are not over-edited,
and are not planned to win philologieal laurels for
the editors

To furnish material for socalled reading at sight, a
portion of' the text ol each author has been printed
with only such brief notes as are absolutely necessary
to the under-standing of the text. These notes are given
on the same page with the text. This material can be
used also for the rapid reading now generally recognized
as a valuable substitute for sight-reading.

The typography and manufacture of the books have
been no less a care than their contents The type is
large and clear, generously spaced and leaded; the
paper of a dull tint restiul to the eyes; the binding·
firm, but such as to allow the book to open flat. Maps,
plans, and illustrations are numerous, and are chosen
not for ornament, but ior real illustration.
