MACMILLAN'S LATIN SERIES

COMMENTS

“l am sure it will ronse high anticipations for the usefulness of your Latin
series. lt is truly not ‘over-edited,’ -a most excellent feature in a school text·
book-and it contains many things which will assist the teacher in making a
student think for himself; and this, after all, is the great object of all our
reaching.''

J. P. Cushing, Head illuster, Hllllwuse Hrglr ⁴S'cltool, Nero Haven, Conn.
“The series is well plarmed. The Nepos of Mr. Barss sets a high scholarly
mark.''

Jared W. Scudder, Latin illuster, Albuny Academy, Alhmy, N. Y.
··Ι think it is one of the handsomcst schoolbooks Ι have ever seen. The
impression it has made upon me thus far is exceedingly favorable.”

Lyman R. Allen, Stafe Narmal School, North Adonis, Mass.

*Ἰ am much pleased with the book. Its appearance is up to your usual
standard, and its illustrations are far superior to any l can recall in any Latin
text-book. Ι like also the author's work. While Ι believe that the gaining of
arighi attitude toward translation and Latin composition (the substitution of
one known idiom for another) must depend mostly upon the teacher and only
slightly upon the book, yet Ι think Mr. Barss bas done much to help the teacher
see and enforce this; his notes show frequently not the solution but how to
reach it.''

Frederic S. Shepherd, Superlntendent osSclrools, Asbuty Parl. N. J

“The Nepos is a very attractive book, especially for sight-reading. Thc type
is beautiful, the illustrations are excellent, and the notes adequate. The Exer-
cises in Writlng Latin appended are a verywaluable feature.''

Lila V. North, Woman's Collega, lraltimore.

“A beautiful book-a credit to the publishers. The type and paper are so
clear, and the illustrations not only interesting but unusual, so that the book
produces at first sight a desire to know it better. The notes, word—groups‚ and
ex=·rcises l think both simple and valuable.”

Everett W. Savvyer, Assoclate Pros‘essor os Latin, Acadio Collega, Wolsville,
N. S.

“l have had the pleasure of examining the.initial volume of Macmillan's
Latin Series, Cornelius Nepos, l'wenly Lim, by Mr. Barss. The book is a
model of what a schoolbook may be made by the intelligent cooperation of
publisher and editor. Usefulness, accurate scholarship, and attractiveness
mark the book. lt satisfies alike the book lover, the scholar, and the teacher.
lf the succeeding volumes of the series reach the same degree nf excellence as
that attained by Mr. Bnrss's Nepos, the series ought to have a wide use in pre-
paratory schools.''
