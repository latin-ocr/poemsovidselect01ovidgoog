DEUCALION AND PYRRHA 207

69. inopi vlotiu: i.e. inopia vr'ctus, from lack of fenei, abl. os enen
cause. Cf. Milton, Per. Len, 11. 777:— 22

“ Those few escaped
Famine and anguish will at last consume,
Wandering that watery desert.’'

111. neucnuou Ano eunnnn(um.1.313-415)

1. Aonios: Boeotiam, called Aoniam becausean ancient
· race of Boeotia was said to be descended from Aon, a son of
Neptune.' We might have expected Aeneia, agreeing with arva .
understood from arvis ,· this use of the name of a people for that
of their country will be familiar from Caesar.

2. dum: se longas.

3. pare: sc. eret, to which pars is predicate.

Ι 4. verticibus duobus: instrumental ablative. Parnassus has
but one very lofty peak, though there are two lower but more famous
ones ol limestone‚ between which lay the famous fount of Castalia.
These clins were called Phaedriades, the resplendent, because they
faced south and received the full rays of the sun. -petit astra:
very prettily and poetically expressed. Note the interlocked
order of adj. and noun. ι

5. nomine: A. 253; B. 2263 G. 3973 H. 4803 M. 650.—
Parnaeus: Parnassus had many caves and romantic grottoes,
and was regarded as the chief abode of Apollo and the Muses.
At its base lay Delphi, the seat of the great oraclo—oaen-
mina: subject.

6. ubi: :ubi primun-Deucalion: son of Prometheus,
while his wife Pyrrha was daughter of Epimetheus brother of Pro·
metheus. According to the Greek account, Deucalion was fore-
warned of the flood by his father and told to build an ark. The

· son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, Hellen, was the eponymous hero
and founder ol the Greek (Hellenic) race. -cetera: all things
else.

7. consorte tori: Pyrrha—vectus: sometimes left un-
translated‚ but it seems to lend vividness here. Deucalion and
Pyrrha were said to have floated about in a small boat fornine
days.
