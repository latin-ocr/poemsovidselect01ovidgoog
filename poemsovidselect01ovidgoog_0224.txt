THE FOUR AGES 193

12. mollia securae otia gentes: observe the symmetry and
L-l‡A
harmony of this line, which is a good example of the interlocked
order so common in prose and poetry.-seourae: used predi·
catively and to be translated by an adverbial phrase. A. 19¹3
B. 2393 G. 325. R. 63 H. 497.—otia: cf. ora, v. 5.

13. Ipsa: with tellus, v. Ι14. Note how strongly the attention
is drawn to both ipsa and tellus by their long separation. Cf.
v. 1.—1psa per se: usually per se ipsa in prose, and practically
equivalent to sponte sua in v. 2.-immun1s ι untaaed,· immunis,
z'ntactca and sancta qualify tellus, which is here spoken of as a
human being, for these words properly describe persons. — nec:
and not ,· it joins saucia with immunis and intacta, and negatives
sancia, to make it parallel with immunis and intacta, which are
negatived by the. prefix in. For the thought cf. IV. 263, 2643

and Verg. Georg. 1. 127, 128 : —
Ipsaque tellus

omnia liberius nullo poscenteferebat.

15. contenti: sc. homines, referring to the men of the golden
age—cibis: A. 254. b. 2; B. 219. ις G. 401. w. 63 H. 476. ις
Μ. 629. -nullo cogente: under no compulszbn. Notice how
frequently this idea comes up: apsa‚z'1nmunis‚intacta‚ nec saucia,
perse, nullo cogente, sine semine, inarata. lt is directly.the
opposite of the thought in v. 49.

16. arbuteos fetus: the fnrit of the wild strawherry-tree is
meant. It was of a bright red color, and somewhat like our
strawherry, but smaller and insipid in taste. Note this use of the
adj. where we should use a substantive in the gen. case. lt
is a frequent usage in ovid—montana fraga: the common
strawbetry. Cf. Vergil's humi nascentia fraga—legebant:
used together or were went to gether. Note this use of the
imperfect.

17. ¹corna: the cornel-cherry, a berry with very little meat,
like our wild cherry. Its mention helps to emphasize the easily
satisfied appetites of the men of the Golden Age-mora:
blackberries‚ but in VlII. 71 it means mulberrz'es. ¹

18. quae . . . glandis: in translating begin with glandn.
This incorporation of the antecedent in the relative clause is very

frequent in Latin, and the ¹arrangement throws special emphasis
