ioot of the hexameter is commonly a dactyl ; when a
spondee is found in this foot, the verse is called a
spaadalc verse. The sixth foot is always considered
a spondee. But the slight pause at the end of the
verse makes it possible ior a short syllable to stand
here. The final syllable is therefore called syllaba
anceps (doubtful syllable). The syllables of a metrical
foot may belong to one or more words The constitu-
tion of the hexameter may, then, be represented thus :-

‘u-vl -Q'vl ἾΤυΙ-ιῖυῙ-ὖῖ) W!
Scaasian is ‘the division of a verse into its metrical
ieet; hence to scan a verse, we must know the quantity

oi the syllables composing each word. The rules oi
quantity can be found in any Latin grammar. Some

. technical terms of prosody will be treated here.
The long hexameter must have some place where

the reader may pause to catch his breath. There are

. two kinds oi pauses,¹the Caesara and the Diacresis.

A Caesura occurs when a word ends aaltla'a a foot:

sponte„ suinsine. lege..iidem..reatumquencorlebat.

The caesural pauses are here marked by double lines.
The feet are separated by single lines: sponte su is a
foot, because the three syllables fill out the require-
ments of the dactyl; again, oer'n rec is a foot‚ because
its two syllables fill out the requirements of a spondee.
It will be seen that a caesura may fall after a long sylla-
ble (—y o υ or -y-l, or after the first short syllable of
the dactyl (— o ῃ υ). When a caesura falls after the long
syllable, it is called Strong or Mascallae Caesura; when
