viii PREFACE

tated than the selections from the other writings ’
The notes are concise and, it is hoped, as few as
possible for elucidating knotty points Help is given
not merely in explanation ol grammatical matters,
but also in the interpretation of the myths, while
special attention is called to the meaning ol the Latin
word-order, and frequent aid is given for making a
correct and fluent English rendering. As aids to
the study of verse, a briei summary of the general
laws of quantity and scansion is given in the intro-
duction, together with copious exerciseS‚ and the,
quantity of all long vowels is indicated in the earlier
selections. ’

Special attention is called to the selections for rapid
or sight reading and the carefully prepared word-
groups. Itis earnestly hoped that here at least the
pupil will work out the meaning in the Latin word·

order before resorting' to translation. Translation is
difficult, reading comparatively easy, and the artos
reading Latin in the word-order of the Romans once
acquired will he a never-faihng pleasure throughout

life. To this end, constant use should be made of
the word-groups. The root and meaning at the head
of each group should be firmly fixed in the memory
when first consulted, and later reference thereto
should be rather ior the association ol words. A
little slowness here and an earnest effort to master
the groups will smooth the way for a more rapid and
pleasant advance in the future. Itis surprising how
quickly one’s vocabulary increases and how much
more rapid and accurate is one's progress when the
root-words of a language are at one's command.
