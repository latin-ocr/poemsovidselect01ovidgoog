XXVIII. PENELOPE TO ULYSSES (HEROIDES I).

The Heroides consist of letters from lonely wives to their hus-
bande. They present mythology inan entirely new light, and
are perhaps the most popular of all Ovid's writings. The letter
of Penelope to Ulysses is generally regarded as the best and is
given here in full.

1. Hane: sc. eprstulam. — lento: Ulysses wandered ten years
after the destruction of Troy, and the Trojan War itseli had also
lasted ten years. Homer’s Odyssey tells the story of the advent-
ures of Ulysses on his homeward journey.

2. nil rescribas: A. 266. a, B. 275· 23 G. 263. 2. a;
H. 560. ις Μ. 714.-ven1: imperative.

3. invisa puellis: because their husbands and lovers were
kept away so long.

4. tanti ruit: were worth so much,· tanti is genos value.
Note again the frequent occurrence of a singular verb with two
subjects.

6. adulter: Paris or Alexander, son of Priam, who carried off 116
Helen, wife of Menelaus, and thus caused the Trojan War.

7. mihi quaerenti: as Itry,· apresent participle is frequently
best rendered into English by as with a finite verb-tallere:
while away.

8. tela': nominative singular. Penelope was sought by many
suitors, and in order to put them off as long as possible, she
promised to marry when a shroud which she was weaving for
Lae'rtes, her father-in-law, was finished. She undid at night
what she wove by day, and sor a long time thus deceived her
suitors.
