8 INTRODUCTION

it falls after a short syllable, it is called Weale or Femi-
nine or Τ roclzaic Caesura. We may have a caesura
whenever a word ends within a foot, but the caesura
which most commonly coincides with a rhetorical pause
is the semiquinaria or penthemimeral the strong caesura
in the third foot :-

cum subito iuvelnis„pe‹1i.bus tehh'rre repulsi.

Next in importance is the semiseptenaria or leepletlee-
mimeral, the strong caesura in the fourth foot, which
is often accompanied by the semiternaria or trihemim-
eral, the strong caesura of the second foot : -

non gale,ae,1.n6n. ensis erant ;., sine . militis r fissi.

If the semiternaria fails,a weak caesura of the second
. foot occurs as the secondary caesura. Sometimesa

weak caesura of the third foot is found.
A De'aeresz's occurs when a word and a foot end
together:—

cessantem vidit, non.11esperus;„il1a duabus.

Here diaeresis occurs after Hesperus. Diaeresis after
the third foot, especially if thisbe a spondee, is most
careiully avoided. .
