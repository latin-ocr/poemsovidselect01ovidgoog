PREFACE

γ Iu any justification is needed ior sending forth
another edition of selections from the writings of
Ovid, it will be found, I trust, in the growing demand
ior some easier poetry than Vergil’s in the earlier
years oi Latin reading. ,The Metamorphoses of
Ovid, bright and ‘simple as they are, crowded with
myth and fable that ever attract and hold the atten-
tion of the young, are peculiarly suitable for use in
the schools, and offer excellent preparation for the

. more arduous work to corne. Indeed, no simplet

poetry for this period can be found, and it is ear-
nestly to be hoped that Ovid will become more and
more popular and thus let Vergil assume his proper
- place later in the course. Vergil is more difficult,
and a much surer knowledge of the Latin tongue is
needed to appreciate his stately and finished verse,
not to speak of the maturer intellect necessary to
grasp the meaning and content oi so great an epic.

This edition, intended primarily for the use of
schools, consists of about three thousand verses care-
fully annotated and about one thousand verses for
rapid reading, with brief notes at the bottom of the
page. In the belief that the Metamorphoses are
, best adapted tor an introduction to Latin verse, the
selections thereirom, which torm the greater part of

the book, are put first, and are more fully anno·
