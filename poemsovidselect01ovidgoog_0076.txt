TRANSLATIONS OF Η ORA ΟΕ.

What form oi death could him effright‚
Who, uneoneern'd, with ebeedfeet sight,
Oould view the surges mounting steep,
. And monstere rolling in the deep?

could ihrough the ranke of mingo,
With eternis ¹above, end rocks below?
In vain did Neiure’s wiee command
Divide the waterslsrom the land,
Ii dering shipS, end men profane,
Invade th’ inviolable main, ’
'Ph’ eiernel fenees overleap‚
And pass ei will the boundlese deep.
No tofi, no herdrhip ean restrein

· Ambitione man, inured to pein3

. The more eonfin'd, ihe more bedrieze,
And at forbidden querry ffiee.
Thus bold Prometheus did aspiro,
And stole from Heav’n the reed of fire3
A trein of ills, a ghestly erew,

. 'Phe robber’s blazing trane pursue:
Fieree Famine with her meagre face,
And severs of the fiery rece
In swerms th’ offending wreteh surround‚
All brooding on the blested ground:
And limping Death, lesh'd on by Pate,
Comes up to shorten half our daie.
This made noh Daedalus beware
With borrow’d winge to eeil in air;
'1'0 Hell Alcides forced hie way,

Plunged through the lake and sneich'd the prey. (θ
Nay, seerce the gode, or heavenly elimes
Are sefe from our eudaeioue crimes;
We reach ab J ove'e imperial emwn, .
And pull th’ unwilling thunder down.
