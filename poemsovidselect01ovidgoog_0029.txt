ΙΙ. SCANSION

Ancient versification was a matter of quantity, To
be able to read Latin poetry with pleasure one must
pronounce correctly, and to pronounce correctly one
must know and carefully observe the quantities of the
syllables. Any one who can pronounce Latin fairly
well and can read with intelligence Longfellow’s
Evangeline will have little trouble in mastering Ovid's
verse.

The poems of Ovid are written¹ in dactylic meters.
The hexameter (ie. averse of six mensures or feet), the
meter of Homer and Vergil, is used in the Meta-
morphoses and Helieettiea; in his other works the
hexameter alternates with the so-called pentameter (ie.

averse of five measures or feet), forming thc Elegiae
Disticle

The basis of all dactylic meters is the dactyl, com-
posed of one long and two short syllables (e'xpressed
-υ υ). Now, by quantity wc mean the time it takes
to pronouncea syllable. The unit of measurement is
the short syllable (marked υ); the long syllable
(marked -) takes just twice as long in pronunciation
as the short. Since, therefore, the long syllable is twice
as long as the short, it is obvious that two short syllables
equal one long; and hence we may expect to find a
spondae, composed of two long syllables (expressed
—-), used instead of the dactyl. So instead of
a foot of three syllables, one'long and two short, we
often havc a foot of two long syllables. The fifth
