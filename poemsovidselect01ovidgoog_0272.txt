‘ IX. ANDROMEDA (Mar. IV. 662-763)

Cassiope, wile of Cepheus, king of Ethiopia, had boasted that
she was more beautiful than the N ereids. To punish her, Nep-
tune sent a sea-monster to ravage the land, and when Cepheus
consulted the oracle of Jupiter Ammon, the god made answer
that his daughter Andromeda must be given up to the monster.
At this crisis Perseus reached Ethiopia on his return srom killing
Medusa. See Gayley's Classr'cMytlrs‚ p. 225 ff. Among the bright
constellations of the northern sky are Andromeda, PerseuS,
Cepheus, Cassiopeia (Cassiope), and Pegasus.
