204 NOTES

· esce 39. defrenato ouran: an example of transferred epithet‚
²1 since we might expect defrenati modifying the subject of volvun-
tur. The construction is abl. of mannen-volvuntur: a

common word in descrihing the violence of waters.

40. Ipse: Neptunus, in contrast to Hi, v. 38. This is the
regular use of epse. -psreussim Poseidon (Neptune) was
called by the Greeks the Eartle-shaker, as the causer of earth·
quakes. ’

41. motu: ie. meme terrae, earthquake. Note the rapid effect
given to this and the following verses by the preponderance of
dactyls. The rapid movement of· the verse corresponds to the
rapid rush of the waters.

4²· per: over.

43. eatis: crops, abl. ossula, which is the neu. pl.. of the perf.
pass. part. of sero, soso, used as a noun. The use of the neuter
participle as a noun is frequent, and should be carefully noted.
A·*113· f; G. ²04· w. 23 H. 4943 M. 1014. Cum satis arbusta is
equivalent to arbusta et sata. ι

44. cumque: que joins penetralia with the preceding nouns,
while cum goes with suis παῖε,- this phrase expresses a closer
union than reem satzi, and denotes real accompaniment. - sacris z
refers to the shrines and images of the household gods, which
were kept in the penetralia, or innermost parts of the house.

46. indeiecta: undemole'slzed, the adj. being used proleptically
in the predicate. —malo : dat. with resistere. A. 227; B. 187. ll. a;

G. 3463 H. 426. ¹3 M. 531.—a1t10r: ersing hzgher or overtop-
pingit. ·

47. pressae: submerged, so as not to be 'seen Note the ’
emphasis gained for pressae and turres by their separation from
each other and by their position. Cf. the fine passage in Para-
dise Lest, 11, 747-752 :—

“All dwellings else
Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
Deep under water rolled3 sea covered sea,
Sea without shore, and in their palaces‚
Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped
And stabled3 of mankind, so numerous late,
All left in one small bottom swum embarked.”
