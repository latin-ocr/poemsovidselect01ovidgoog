scnwstotv 9

Here um in peregrinum is slurred, if pronounced at all,
before ut.

,By hiatus is meant the failure of elision when a final
vowel is kept in pronunciation before a word beginning
with another vowel or with h. This is generally .
avoided by Ovid, who, as a rule‚ allows hiatus only
when the final long vowel or diphthong is shortened.
This is called semi-hiatus:—

§verba loycuehffintoque “vala „Vale‚”1inquit etrtcho.

The final syllable of the second vale is not elided, but ’
ἒ becomes r.

Synaplzeia is the elision of a final syllable in one
verse before the initial vowel of the following verse :—

perque vids vi.diss⁰ homi‚num„simu.licra ferarumqu‘
in silhc⁰¹¹¹ ex ipysis..vi‚sicon1versa Mendai.

The first verse has an extra syllable, que, which is elided

‚ before in of the following verse. The verse which has

the extra syllable is called a hypermeter.

Synz‘aesz's is the pronunciation of two separate vowels
as one syllable: dehinc, agnae (both pronounced as dis-
syllables); omnya for omnia.

Each foot may be divided into tlzesz‘s (the first long
syllable) and arsis (the second long syllable of aspondee
or the two short syllables of a dactyl). The promi-
nence of the thesis of a foot is known as z'ctus Ictus
is commonly treated as a rhythmical accent, and so
marked:—

adremprfrna sat· istnaetds, quaemindicemdllo.
