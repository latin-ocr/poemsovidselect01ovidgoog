When the Minotaur, a fabulous monster, was terrorizing Crete,
King Minos employed Daedalus, the world's greatest artificer‚
to make the famous Labyrinth to confine it. This consisted of

’ many passages¹ ,winding in and out like the river Meander, so
that whatever was shut therein could not escape. The Minotaur
was fed on human flesh, notably the seven youths and maidens
sent yearly as a tribute by AthenS, till Theseus killed the mon·
ster. Daedalus had now fallen into disfavor with Minos, and
wished to leave Crete, but Minos would not allow this. Gayley,
p· 255 ff·

of prior action latent in the Latin perfect.
