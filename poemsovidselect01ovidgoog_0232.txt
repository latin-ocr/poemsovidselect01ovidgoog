THE FLOOD 201

15. ardeat: subj. in indir. diso, but the direct lorrn would also
besubj. A. 3203 B. 2833 G. 631. 2; H. 591· 1; M. 836.-
mundi . . . operosa: tlte tailnnonght mass as the world. Moles
emphasizes the bnlk and wezgnt or masst'mmss ot the world,
while operosa emphasizes the difficulty with which this mass

was wrought. Moles also includes the latter idea; cf. Verg.
Aen. 1. 33,

Tantae malis erat Romanam candere gentem.

-laboretz should latter. One school ot ancient philosophy
believed that the world had arisen from lire, and would be de-
stroyed by lire. We have here probably a reference to the
Phaethon episode. Cf. 2 Peter 3. 7: “But the heavens and the
earth which are now, by the same word are kept in stote, reserved
unto lire against the day ol judgment and perdition ol ungodly
men.'' Cf. also Lucretius 5. 96:-

Una dies dabit exitta, multasque per annas
sustentata ruet males et machina mnndi.

16. Tela: fulmina. - cyclopum: the Cyclopes were repre-
sented in the Odyssey as a race of giants given to cannibalism.
They dwelt in caves on the mountain sides of an island which was
afterwards identified with Sicily. They knew nothing of the arts
ol civilizati0n‚ and seared neither gods nor men. Hesiod names
three, Brontes, Steropes and Arges. The later poets represent
thern as using the caverns ol Mount Etna lor their smithy.

17. placet: sc. ei, and trans. he resolves npan (lit. pleases
him). Note the separation os noun and adj. by the verb.

18. perdere . . . demittere: these phrases are in apposition
with paena, and afford a very good example ot ὕστερον πρότερον
Ὁμηρικῶς (‘ hysteron proteron alter the manner of Homer '), in¹
which the logical order of ideas is reversed. - demittere: note
the force of dn. — eaelo: cl. “And the windows ol heaven were
opened,’' Gen. 7. 11.

19· Aeoliis: os Aeolus. See the note on arbuteos setus, 1. 16.
Aeolus was the ruler of the winds (Homer's ταμίης ἀνέμων). Cf.
Verg. Aen. 1. 52 tl-Aquilonem: from the standpoint ota
Roman, since the north wind brings cold, lair weather in Italy.
