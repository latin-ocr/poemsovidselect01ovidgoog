208 NOTES

8. Corycidas: Greek form of acc.; cf. Themin, v. 9. The
Corycium was a large cave on the side of Mt. Parnassus.—
numina montis: possibly the Muses, to whom later the
Castalian spring was sacred—adorant: the plural verb gives

.prominence to both Deucalion and Pyrrha in the worship.

9. Themin: goddess of justice, daughter of Uranus and Gaea.
At this time she presided over the Delphic oracle.— oracla: by
syncope for oracula, as vinclum for vinculum, and parz'clum for
pert'culum. ι

10. non quiequam: = nullus or nec . . . ullus, and qualifies
vir as an adj. Quisquam is found chiefly in negative sentences.
A. 202. b. c3 B. 252.4; G.317. ¹3 H. 5133 M. 1071.-neo:
note that the Romans never use et nan, sednon, etc, save when
aspecial word is to be negarine-aequi: A. 218. b; Β.
3041- az G· 375· N· 13 H· 451· 33 M· 574·

11. aut: the negative is continued3 hence ulla-metuen-
tior deorum: mora gad-faaring; for dearum, see the note on
aequi,v.1o.—ulla: necessary here because qua'squam has no
feminine.

12. ut: temporal‚ when-orbem: acc. subject of the inf.
stagnare. For the construction here, see the note unsara, Il. 7. ν

13. virum: necessary here to render the gender of unum
absolutely certain, while mulierem is not necessary with unam‚·
thus a place is left in v. 14 for vz'ctet. Repetition usually adds
emphasis or vividnesS‚ but neither seems much heightened here,
and the repetition is somewhat cacophonous. - de . .. milibus :
os those wlco ware so aaany thousandr just now-unum: ern-
phatic, only ane. Note that this implied aab is quite frequent

, in both Greek and Latin.

16. nimbis remotis: the Romans having no perf. act. part,
used in such sentences either the abl. abs. or the more awkward
subordinate clause of time or the like. We may use in English,
beside the perf. act. part. and the subordinate clause, the pres.
act. part. or a cobrdinate clause, but the last two are logically
inexact—aquilone: abl. of means. See the note on ll. 193
and cf. Gen. 8. 1, “And God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters assuaged.'’

17. Note the chiasmus of case-relations in caela terras, aethera
