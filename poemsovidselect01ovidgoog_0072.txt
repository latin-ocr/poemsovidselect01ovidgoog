YRRHA! what ardent stripling now,
In one of thy embower’d retronis, ,
Would prese thee lo indulge his vow‚
Amidst a world of flowers und sweele?
For whom are bound thy inesses bright, ’ ,
With unoonoern so exquisite?
Alae l how oft ehull he bewail
His fiokle stare and suithleee gale,
And share, with unueeustom'd eyes,
When the blaok winde and wetere rise3 “
Though now ihe suushine honr beguiles
His berk along thy golden smiles3
Trustiug to see thee, for his play
For ever keep smooth holiday!
Poor dazzled foole who bask beside thee,

l

And trust, because they never tried thee!
For me, and for my dengers pasl,
'Phe grateful picture hange ui lust
Wilhiu the mighty Neptune's fune,
Who snuloh’d me, drippiug, from the mein.
