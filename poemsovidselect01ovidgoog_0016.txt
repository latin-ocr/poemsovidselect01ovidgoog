PREFACE . ix

The text is that of Riese, with a lew changes
necessary to adapt' certain passages to school use
andan almost complete change in punctuation and
capitalization. Constant use has been made of the
standard 'German editions with notes and ol the
American editions of Kelsey, and Allen and Green-
ough. The Wdrterbuc'lz ¹of Siebelis has also been
very helpful. Lewis’ Elementary' Latin Dictionary
is the basis for the marking of the quantity ol vowels
and has also been of considerable help in the prepa- -
ration of the vocabulary. Ι desire especially to
acknowledge the kindness of Mr. Albertus T. Dud-
ley of Noble and Greenough’s School‚ Boston, who
has selected the illustrations; of Mr. Thomas J. Kier-
nan of the Harvard College Library, and Miss J. Reid
and Mr. J. R. McDonald of The Macmillan Company,
who have also assisted in this work3 also of Mr.
Barss lor permission to use two cuts from his Nepos,
ν In conclusion, I take pleasure in cordially acknowl-
edging my deepest obligations to the editor-in-chief of
this series, Mr. John C. Kirtland, Jr.‚ who has been
untiring in his efforts to make the book consistent
and accurate, and has rendered much assistance by
his many valuable suggestions.
