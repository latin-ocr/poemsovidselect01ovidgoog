reader, though he is sometimes wordy and diffuse; his

Amores (Loves), in three books, consisting of forty-
nine elegies, which sketch the amatory side of the poet's
life.

Heroides (Heroines), twentyone love-letters repress

husbands; several of these are now generally supposed
to have been written by some imitator of Ovid.

De Medicamine Faciei (T lte Ure (ff cosmetur), of
which only a fragment of one hundred lines has reached
us, addressed to women, and giving advice on the art of
the toilet.

Ars Amatoria (T lte Art of Leve), in three books (the
first two books addressed to men, and the third to
women), treating of the successful ways of winning love,
and of retaining it when once won. ,
